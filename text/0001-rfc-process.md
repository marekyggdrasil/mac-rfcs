## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for improvements to be made to Grin.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The main goal for writing RFCs related to MAC! project is coordinating breaking changes and documenting the critial protocol-related choices.

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

This process draws inspiration _extensively_ from Grin's RFC process, where much credit for the process is due.

Most decentralized cryptocurrency projects have adopted an RFC-like process to manage adding new features.

Bitcoin uses BIPs which are an adaptation of Python's PEPs. These processes are similar to the Rust RFC process which has had success in the Rust community as well as in other cryptocurrency projects like Peercoin.
